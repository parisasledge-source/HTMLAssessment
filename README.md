##HTMLAssessment

###Description

HTMLAssessment is an html structured project.
Inside of the body of this html document, there are several elements with their respective section headers.  
There are four section headers in this document with these titles: TEXT, TABLE, LIST and FORM.
1. TEXT Section:
There are three paragraphs under the section header "TEXT". The first word of each paragraph is in bold. The second paragraph is formatted as a block quotation and emphasized.
2. TABLE Section:
There is a table element under the section header "TABLE" with data to simulate a game score.
3. LIST Section:
There is a nested list for each of the game player teams. Therefore there are two nested lists which are made of nested lists themselves. Each list has team logo, name, and players. The team name links to the team home page.
4. FORM Section:
There is a form element under the section header "FORM". This form includes input text fields for first name and last name. It also has a drop-down menu that allows the user to select their favorite sport from a predefined list. The form also has checkboxes indicating whether they have ever personally played/attended/coached/bet on this sport. The last part is the radio button group indicating whether they prefer the amateur, college, or professional version. And finally there is a submit button with the label "Submit Query" at the end of the form.
