## HTMLAssessment

### Description

HTMLAssessment is an html structured project.
Inside of the body of this html document, there are several elements with their respective section headers.  
There are four section headers in this document with these titles: TEXT, TABLE, LIST and FORM.

1. TEXT Section:

There are three paragraphs under the section header "TEXT". The first word of each paragraph is in bold. The second paragraph is formatted as a block quotation and emphasized.

2. TABLE Section:

There is a table element under the section header "TABLE" with data to simulate a game score. It includes the name of each team, the score for each team in the first half and second half of the game and the total scores.

3. LIST Section:

There is a nested list for each of the game player teams. Therefore, there are two nested lists which are made of nested lists themselves. Each list has team logo, team name, and players names. The team name links to the team home page.

4. FORM Section:

There is a form element under the section header "FORM". This form includes input text fields for first name and last name. It also has a drop-down menu that allows the user to select their favorite sport from a predefined list. The form also has checkboxes indicating whether they have ever personally played, attended, coached, or bet on this sport. The last part is the radio button group indicating whether they prefer the amateur, college, or professional version of the game. And finally, there is a submit button with the label "Submit Query" at the end of the form.

### Lesson learned and Technologies used
1. Using 'blockquote' tag to change a regular paragraph to a block quote and also using 'em' tag to change it to an emphasized paragraph.
2. Creating a table, using both colspan and rowspan attributes.
3. Creating header, footer, and caption for the table.
4. Using 'ol' (for ordered) and 'ul' (or bulleted) to create lists and nested lists.
5. Using 'image' tags for displaying the logos and understanding that 'image' is a type of element which does not require a closing tag.
6. Using 'a' tag to include a link in the page. The attribute, href of this tag, links the team name to the team home page.
7. Data Inputs of the 'form' element for user inputs (using 'input' tag), including text for names, checkboxes, radio buttons and "Submit Query" submit button.
8. Using 'br' tags for basic formatting.
